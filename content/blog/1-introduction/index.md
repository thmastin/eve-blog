## Introduction: What I'm Doing 

# The Premise 

![Silas Swift Headshot](../../images/silasswift.png)

Meet Silas Swift. He's a burgeoning station trader basing himself out of Dodixie to start. 

This isn't really a **challenge** exactly.  There's not any strict rules involved with what we're doing or any goals.  The goal is to have fun and create a station trader alt.

Just some guidelines (always subject to change):

- Any activity will be towards making more ISK
- I won't be sending any ISK from any of my other characters. With maybe the exception of buying skill books.
- He will run missions (but only in the goal of ruthlessly driving down tax rates)
- He will do the AIR dailies for the sweet 10K skill points a day until fully trained. The 1 Million ISK won't be bad to start either.
- The account will not be plexed to start, but will be Omega.  I dont' want this to be a job to get to Omega, and I want to be able to use the Omega training skills.
- I'll be trying out Eve Guru's Station Trading module.

# Starting Point

This is our starting point 18,922,956 ISK.  This was generated by running all of the Starter Agent missions and what I picked up through the AIR program while doing so.  

That's our seed capital.  Join me to see if we can get it to grow.
