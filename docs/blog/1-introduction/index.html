    <article><div><h2>Introduction: What I'm Doing</h2><h1>The Premise</h1><p><img src="../../images/silasswift.png" alt="Silas Swift Headshot"></img></p><p>Meet Silas Swift. He's a burgeoning station trader basing himself out of Dodixie to start.</p><p>This isn't really a <b>challenge</b> exactly.  There's not any strict rules involved with what we're doing or any goals.  The goal is to have fun and create a station trader alt.</p><p>Just some guidelines (always subject to change):</p><ul><li>Any activity will be towards making more ISK</li><li>I won't be sending any ISK from any of my other characters. With maybe the exception of buying skill books.</li><li>He will run missions (but only in the goal of ruthlessly driving down tax rates)</li><li>He will do the AIR dailies for the sweet 10K skill points a day until fully trained. The 1 Million ISK won't be bad to start either.</li><li>The account will not be plexed to start, but will be Omega.  I dont' want this to be a job to get to Omega, and I want to be able to use the Omega training skills.</li><li>I'll be trying out Eve Guru's Station Trading module.</li></ul><h1>Starting Point</h1><p><img src="../../images/2025-10-07-wallet.png" alt="Current Wallet"></img></p><p>This is our starting point 18,922,956 ISK.  This was generated by running all of the Starter Agent missions and what I picked up through the AIR program while doing so.</p><p>That's our seed capital.  Join me to see if we can get it to grow.</p></div></article>
